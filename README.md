## Overview

This project showcases the capabilities of using the Yolov8 object detection model, along with Ultralytics and Supervision libraries, for the purpose of crowd detection and counting. It specifically focuses on analyzing video footage of pedestrian movement, utilizing polygon zones to accurately count individuals as they enter designated areas. Designed and implemented within a Jupyter Notebook environment, this solution demonstrates a practical application of cutting-edge object detection technology to address real-world challenges in crowd management and surveillance.
